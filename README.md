# Livefyre.js

Livefyre.js is the core library that should be installed on each Livefyre Customer Website. Amongst other things, it provides `Livefyre.require`, which can be used to fetch other Livefyre web components.

## Add to your Site

Note: The recommended installation path is to include a `<script>` tag to a cdn release of [Livefyre/Livefyre-scout](//github.com/Livefyre/Livefyre-scout), which is very tiny and will download the latest version of Livefyre.js for you.

```html
<script src="//cdn.livefyre.com/Livefyre.js"></script>
```

## Modules

### Livefyre.require

#### What it is

Livefyre.require is a custom AMD loader based on [requirejs](http://requirejs.org/). It can be used to load various packages published by Livefyre, and so it presents a convenient and intuitive integration path.

An important feature of Livefyre.require is that its packages are versioned using [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). Packages can be pinned to a version or a range. This gives you, the integrator, flexibility when customizing an integration.

Pinning to a full version guarantees that the Livefyre package code running on the page will not change, while pinning to a major or minor range ensures that you will get new bugfixes and features without having to change the integration code.

* `package-name#1` - Major version pin to v1. You'll get all new updates that maintain a backward-compatible API.
* `package-name#1.1` - Minor version pin to v1.1. You'll get all bugfixes to this minor version, but no additional functionality or changes to default behavior.
* `package-name#1.1.1` - Patch version pin to v1.1.1. The behavior of this embed will never change, even if there are bugfixes.

An example integration using Livefyre.require could look like this:

```html
<!-- First add Livefyre.js to the page -->
<script src="//cdn.livefyre.com/Livefyre.js"></script>

<!-- Then load up all the desired Livefyre packages and Do Stuff in the callback -->
<script>
Livefyre.require([
    'lfawesome#1',
    'lfsuperawesome#2.1.2'
], function (LFAwesome, LFSuperAwesome) {
    var greatness = new LFAwesome();
    // etc..
});
</script>
```

#### Neat Tricks

Livefyre require has some options when loading modules, these are exposed via query params on the current page URL.

`lfmin` If there is an unminified main/index file for the modules, fetch it: `{0|1}`

Caveat, the presence of non-minified files is up to the module author.

{file}.min.js is fetched by default. The non-minified file is expected to be named {file}.js and present in the same directory.

`lfcdn` Choose whether to fetch the cached files or use the originating s3 bucket: `{0|1}`

`lfVersion` Supply a dictionary-like of package version overrides e.g. `?lfVersion[herp]=1.0.0&lfVersion[derp]=2.0.0`. These version values will take precedence.

E.g. www.io.xxx?lfcdn=0&lfmin=0&lfenv=qa will fetch the non-cached, non-minified, qa version of the module.

`lfbucket` It is possible to deploy to different s3 buckets for testing builds, etc: `{dev|qa|uat}` are supported by lfcdn and by this option.

`lfjsUrl` It is possible to have scout fetch Livefyre.js from a specified url.


#### Exciting! So what are the available packages and what versions should I use?

The current LF packages are listed here: [packages.html](//cdn.livefyre.com/packages.html)

#### Deploy Process

1) Push a new version of the module to the CDN using [lfcdn](https://github.com/Livefyre/lfcdn), this will place the files at a conventional url so that Livefyre.require can find your module. The main/index file for the module should be specified in the lfpackages.json.

2) Build [executor](http://build.fyre.co/jenkins/job/executor/).

3) Livefyre.require(module#{version})!

```
Livefyre.require(['streamhub-input#v0.2'], function (Input) {
  console.log('Haz Input module: ' + !!Input);
});
```

#### How can I test out pre-release versions of packages?

You may see non-prod versions listed amongst the available packages. New features will be deployed to our UAT testing environment before appearing in production integrations.

Get tomorrow's code today by specifying the a prerelease env rather than a semver version. e.g.:

```
Livefyre.require(['streamhub-input#qa'], cb);
```

Supported envs are `dev`, `qa`, and `uat`.
